# Blog README

Website itself is hosted externally in Wordpress, all other files are included here (think build files).

## Scripts (`/js`)

Includes scripts for toggling header styles.

## CSS (`/css`)

Includes styles for adjusting the Wordpress site header, fonts, and icons.

## Images (`/img`)

Most images are hosted through Wordpress, but additional images may be included here if necessary. However, this folder SHOULD be reserved for images that are not connected to blog posts (e.g. UI) and aren't used on other sites (and therefore would be in the root website `/img`).
